# KAI Capability Fabric — Ledger (§71) + Certification (§74)

Honest state, per directive §73/§74: **cloning/verifying an upstream is not success**, and no
row is forced to PASS. As of **2026-08-26**, branch `feat/kai-capability-fabric`.

## Fabric core certification (§74)

The governed **core is built and tested** (48 pure tests, 0 failures). Live integrations that
require a running KAI runtime, real installs, or a browser are honestly PENDING/EXTERNAL_BLOCKED.

| component | state | evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Capability Registry (§15) | **PASS** | `registry.py`, tests |
| Capability Brain (§16) | **PASS** | `brain.py`, routing tests |
| Capability Graph (§17) | **PASS** | `graph.py`, closure/cycle/conflict tests |
| Automatic Selection (§28) | **PASS** | weighted scoring + observable rationale, §65 tests |
| Automatic Activation (§18/§20) | **PASS (logic)** | lifecycle state machine; live activation needs a runtime |
| Automatic Deactivation (§19) | **PASS** | `deactivate()` maps every trigger to a teardown |
| Dependency Resolution (§60) | **PASS** | REQUIRES closure, deps-first ordering |
| Conflict Resolution (§61) | **PASS** | conflict/alternative collapse |
| Resource Policy (§26) | **PASS (logic)** | resource filter; live metering not wired |
| Security Policy (§25) | **PASS** | `evaluate_policy` + tests |
| RBAC (§22) | **PASS** | scope/role gating in the policy |
| Approval Gates (§25) | **PASS** | REQUIRE_APPROVAL tiers |
| Prompt Injection (§24) | **PASS** | untrusted-by-default + `scan_for_injection` + inert proposals |
| Secret Isolation (§50) | **PARTIAL** | broker designed in docs; not wired to a live secret store |
| Audit (§59) | **PARTIAL** | event taxonomy defined; sink wiring EXTERNAL_BLOCKED (App B down) |
| Nexus Integration (§54–58) | **PENDING** | Capabilities panel not yet built |
| Mission Integration (§58) | **PARTIAL** | correlation model defined; live mission wiring pending |
| Claude Code Integration (§32/§72) | **PARTIAL** | CLAUDE.md routing section added; MCP installs EXTERNAL_BLOCKED |

\* context7 / playwright are **live in the Claude Code session** (used this session), not in the
KAI runtime (App B Docker-down).

## What blocks CERTIFIED for the external capabilities

1. **No network in the Bash sandbox** → cannot install (pip/npm/git clone/`claude mcp add`).
2. **KAI runtime (App B) is Docker-down** → no live host to wire adapters into.
3. **Env-mutation + credentials require operator approval** (§1/§76) → `claude mcp add`,
   `curl|bash` installers, and GitHub/OpenWork/Buzz credentials are not autonomous actions.

The path to CERTIFIED per capability: install (approved) → build adapter → health check →
auto-routing verified live → integration-tested → certify. None may be forced (§74).
