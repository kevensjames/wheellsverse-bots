"""Governed, READ-ONLY Holding Operations endpoints (owner-only kai.ultra).

Dormant unless KAI_HOLDING_ENABLED — main.py only includes this router when the flag is on,
so a disabled deployment has ZERO new surface. All endpoints are GET/read-only and source-backed
(no fabricated financials). No write/send endpoints exist here — external actions are separate and
approval-gated by design.
